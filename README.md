# Datasets & Teams

In the semester project of this course, teams of 3 students must pick a dataset and a project
related to Big Data Analytics. It is highly recommended for each team to include at least one
member from each discipline: Business, Statistics, and Informatics. The objective of the
project is to bring together both frameworks and analytic topics from the course, as well as
provide experience in trying to use big data to tackle real-world problems.

The initial step of the project is to create the teams and select a topic/dataset. The following
table introduces different datasets from diverse fields. Moreover, we also provide a list of
dataset portals and repositories. Last but not least, a small list of representative APIs is
introduced. Furthermore, you can utilize more than one dataset to achieve your goal, and
you also are free to select datasets that are not in the list.

You have to:

1. select one or more datasets,
2. describe the reason that you selected the dataset(s) and why this dataset(s) is interesting for you,
3. specify why this dataset is related to big data (you can consider the 3Vs or/and 5Vs of the introduction), and
4. define your own subject of interest and describe the objectives of your project.

The description of the project proposal should be concise, ideally limited to approximately one page.
The objectives of the project must align with the curriculum of the course. It is imperative that
each dataset undergoes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) at the outset. Subsequently,
the project should incorporate at least two methodologies covered in this course, which
may include, but are not limited to:

1. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, etc.,
2. Graph Analysis,
3. Text Analysis,
4. Analysis or Processing of Streaming Data, and
5. Recommendation Systems.

It is important to note that the objectives of your project are subject to modification as the project
progresses.

Note: Each team is required to choose a unique dataset. In the event that the same or
similar dataset is selected by multiple teams, only the team that chose it first will be allowed
to work on it.

Please send your project proposal (via email) and the names of your group members
before Monday 23.2.2025. Your email should have the subject
“dsc511.project.<surnames>”.

Note: Datasets previously used in the first semester courses (e.g., DSC 510) are not permitted
for this project.
